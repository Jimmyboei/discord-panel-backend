# Discord.Tools

This is the Express.js app of the [discord panel app](https://github.com/Jimmyboei/discord-panel-frontend). It provides APIs for the frontend React app to connect to discord for bot login, send message, get message and related server and channel informations.

The deployed netlify site can be found [here](https://kaiqi-discord-panel.netlify.app/)

To use the app, download the code and use following instructions:
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm run devStart` to start the local server
- ensure the server is listening on localhost port 3000 so the app can work properly
- go to [netlify site](https://kaiqi-discord-panel.netlify.app/) to login and enjoy
